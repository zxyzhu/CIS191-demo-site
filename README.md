CIS 191 Project 3
-----------------

1. When you push to cloud, the git hook copies the files from the deploy branch into the directory ~/www. It then echoes a message that the server is starting, goes into the www folder, and then runs server.py.

2. It publishes the ~/www directory online.

3. A bare repository contains only the files in the .git folder and no working copies of the source files.
